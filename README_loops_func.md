#FUNCTIONS_LOOPS
This repo contains a bunch of beginner python projects I built to practice functions,loops,and input validation.Each one helped me understand
how to structure logic,handle user input,and simulate real-world tasks using basic programming.

#PROJECTS
-prime_num_checker
A simple tool to check if a number is prime.It includes input checks so the user dosen't crash the program by entering
weird stuff.
-ATM_simulation
Mimics a basic ATM interface.You enter a PIN,then choose options like checking balance,depositing,withdraw or exit.
It loops until you decide to leave.
-Student_marks_Analyzer
Takes student marks and gives back performance feedback.I used functions to keep things clean and reused logic for 
different grade levels.
-Number_Utilities_display
A mini toolkit that does things like counting digits,reverse of the number and sum of the digits and other number-based operations.

#HOW TO RUN...
-Open the folder in your code editor or terminal.
-Run any script using python3.
-example: python3 ATM_simulation.py
-Follw the prompts and interact with the program.

#WHAT I LEARNED...
-How to use if-else logic to validate inputs(no alphabets,no decimals,no crashes).
-How loops work-especially while True and how to break out of them properly.
-How to write functions that make code easier to read and reuse'
-How to simulate real-world system like ATMs and grading tools using just basic python.
-How to write beginner-friendly documentation that explains what the code does in plain english.
